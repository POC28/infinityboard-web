InfinityBoard
==============
InfinityBoard is a planning tool for the visual planers out there. Some people have grave problems with getting a good overall image of a project by browsing texts that are ordered in a set structure. Infinite board want's to break out of these structures and make planing more chaotic and visual.

We want to see the "boards" as digital whiteboards where we can position all our thoughts and ideas; be it images, texts or reference links. And when you have got a good overview you can go into detail mode and start planning down the heirarchy by opening each item on the board as their own board. Here you can really go into the nitty gritty and get all the fine details in place so that your project gets the base you need to get started.

This project will fit into the category productivity as it'll be a great tool to plan a plethora of things: from game design to the family vacation, to system design. The basic idea is really simple, and that will make InfinityBoard a great tool to work with!
